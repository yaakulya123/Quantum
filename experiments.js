        longDescription: `The double-slit experiment is one of the most famous experiments in quantum physics. It demonstrates the wave-particle duality of light and matter.

        When light passes through two closely spaced slits, it creates an interference pattern on a screen behind the slits. This pattern is typical of waves, but interestingly, even when individual photons are sent one by one, they still form an interference pattern over time, suggesting each photon somehow passes through both slits simultaneously.
        
        However, if you try to observe which slit the photon passes through, the interference pattern disappears, and you get two distinct bands, as if the photons are behaving like particles. This experiment illustrates a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics: observation affects the outcome of the experiment.`,

        In this experiment, a beam of silver atoms is passed through a non-uniform magnetic field. Classical physics would predict that the atoms, if they're like tiny magnets with randomly oriented magnetic moments, would be deflected in a continuous distribution.
        
        Instead, the beam splits into discrete components, showing that the angular momentum (spin) of the atoms is quantized - it can only take certain discrete values, not a continuous range. This experiment provided direct evidence for spin quantization, a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics.`,

        Bell's Inequality provides a mathematical framework to test whether quantum mechanics is compatible with "local realism" - the idea that physical properties exist independently of observation and no influence can travel faster than light.
        
        Experiments have consistently violated Bell's Inequality, suggesting that either locality or realism (or both) must be abandoned. This experiment highlights the profound strangeness of quantum mechanics and entanglement.`,

        In this experiment, the choice to observe which path a photon takes (causing it to behave like a particle) or to observe interference (allowing it to behave like a wave) is made after the photon has already passed the double slit.
        
        Remarkably, the photon's behavior corresponds to the type of measurement chosen, even though that choice was made after the photon should have already "decided" whether to behave as a wave or a particle.

        longDescription: `Quantum teleportation is a process that transfers the quantum state of a particle to another particle at a distance, without physically moving the original particle.

        Despite its name, quantum teleportation doesn't transport matter or energy. Instead, it transmits the quantum information that describes a particle's state. This requires three ingredients: quantum entanglement between two particles, a classical communication channel, and a third particle whose state we want to teleport.
        
        The process involves performing a special joint measurement on the particle to be teleported and one of the entangled particles. The result of this measurement is then sent via classical communication to the location of the other entangled particle, where a specific operation is performed to complete the teleportation.
        
        This protocol is fundamental to quantum communication networks and quantum computing, and has been experimentally demonstrated with photons, atoms, and other quantum systems.`,

        longDescription: `The Bloch sphere is a geometric representation of a qubit - the fundamental unit of quantum information - that helps visualize quantum states and operations.

        Unlike classical bits that can only be 0 or 1, qubits can exist in a superposition of states, represented as points on the surface of the Bloch sphere. The north and south poles represent the classical states |0âŸ© and |1âŸ©, while points on the equator represent equal superpositions.
        
        Quantum gates, the building blocks of quantum circuits, transform qubits by rotating the state vector on the Bloch sphere. For example, the X gate flips a qubit from |0âŸ© to |1âŸ© (and vice versa), corresponding to a 180Â° rotation around the X-axis.
        
        This visualization helps provide intuition for the abstract mathematics of quantum computation and illustrates how quantum information differs fundamentally from classical information.`,

        image: 'url(/api/placeholder/300/160)',
        longDescription: `Shor's algorithm, developed by mathematician Peter Shor in 1994, is one of the most important quantum algorithms because it can efficiently factor large numbers - a task believed to be computationally difficult for classical computers.

        The security of widely used RSA encryption depends on the difficulty of factoring large numbers. A quantum computer running Shor's algorithm could potentially break this encryption, which has significant implications for data security.
        
        The algorithm works by reducing the factoring problem to finding the period of a function, which quantum computers can do efficiently using quantum Fourier transform. This demonstrates the potential of quantum computers to solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers.
        
        This simulation demonstrates the key steps of Shor's algorithm, including the quantum period-finding subroutine, and shows how increasing the number size affects the computation's complexity.`,
